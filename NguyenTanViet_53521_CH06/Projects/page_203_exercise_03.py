Problem:
      Elena complains that the recursive newton function in Project 2 includes an extra
      argument for the estimate. The functionâ€™s users should not have to provide this
      value, which is always the same, when they call this function. Modify the definition of the function so that it
      uses a keyword argument with the appropriate default value, and call the function without a second argument to
      demonstrate that it solves this problem.

Solution:

2.0000000929222947
