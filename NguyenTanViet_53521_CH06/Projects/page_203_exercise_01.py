Problem:
   Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study 3.6) in a
   function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument
   and returns the estimate of its square root. The script should also include a main
   function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses
   the enter/return key

Solution:
   Enter a positive number or enter to quit: 2
   The program's estimate is 1.4142135623746899
   Python's estimate is      1.4142135623730951
   Enter a positive number or enter to quit: 3
   The program's estimate is 1.7320508100147274
   Python's estimate is      1.7320508075688772
