Problem:
      Where are module variables, parameters, and temporary variables introduced and
                              initialized in a program?

Solution:
 - Module variables:
        + Introduced: A module-level variable is declared for a particular module. It is available to all
            procedures within that module but not to the rest of the application.
        + Initialized: module variable gets initialized where they are declared inside the module. It is
            initialized to 0 by default.
    - Parameters:
        + Introduced: parameters are declared inside the parenthesis of the function definition
        + Initialized: parameters can be initialized where they are declared or can be declared in the
            parenthesis of the function call
    - Temporary variables:
        + Introduced:  inside a block, they have very short lifetime and hold data that can be discarded or
            is later stored in a permanent variable
        + Initialized: temporary variables can be initialized anywhere inside the block where they are declared.
