Problem:
     exersice_01_page_218.py Three versions of the summation function have been presented in this chapter.
     One uses a loop, one uses recursion, and one uses the reduce function. Discuss the
     costs and benefits of each version, in terms of programmer time and computational
     resources required.

Solution:
- loop: Infinite loop uses continuous CPU cycles, fast execution, iteration makes the code longer.
- recursion: Infinite recursion can crash the system, slow in execution, reduce the size of the code.
- reduce function: More optimized with complex data or code, make your code cleaner, easier to read and maintain.
