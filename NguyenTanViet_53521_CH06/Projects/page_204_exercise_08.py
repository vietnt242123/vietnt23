Problem:

     Lee has discovered what he thinks is a clever recursive strategy for printing the
     elements in a sequence (string, tuple, or list). He reasons that he can get at the
     first element in a sequence using the 0 index, and he can obtain a sequence of
     the rest of the elements by slicing from index 1. This strategy is realized in a
     empty, the first element in the sequence is printed and then a recursive call is
     executed. On each recursive call, the sequence argument is sliced using the
     range 1:. Here is Leeâ€™s function definition:
     def printAll(seq):
    if seq:
        print(seq[0])
        printAll(seq[1:])
  Write a script that tests this function and add code to trace the argument on each
  call. Does this function work as expected? If so, explain how it actually works,
  and describe any hidden costs in running it.

Solution:

"""
def printAll(seq):
    if seq:
        print(seq[0])
        printAll(seq[1:])


printAll("viet")
printAll((7, 9, 8, 4))
printAll([7, 9, 8, 4])
